        <section>
          <p>Modern hiring often starts with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). These systems scan resumes for keywords and formatting they can parse. Tailoring your resume for ATS improves the chance that your application gets seen by a human.</p>

          <h2>1. Analyze the job description</h2>
          <p>Read the job description carefully and highlight required skills, certifications, and technologies. Look for repeated phrases — these are likely important for ATS ranking.</p>

          <h2>2. Mirror language and keywords</h2>
          <p>Where appropriate, use the same language the employer uses. If the JD asks for “React.js” and “TypeScript,” include those exact terms in your skills and experience sections when applicable.</p>

          <h2>3. Use standard headings and simple formatting</h2>
          <p>ATS parsers rely on common headings such as <em>Experience</em>, <em>Education</em>, and <em>Skills</em>. Avoid unusual headings or multi-column layouts that can confuse parsers.</p>

          <h2>4. Prioritize relevant experience and achievements</h2>
          <p>Put the most relevant jobs and accomplishments near the top of your resume. Use short bullet points and start bullets with strong action verbs.</p>

          <h2>5. Quantify results</h2>
          <p>Whenever possible, include numbers that show impact: percentages, revenue, time saved, or headcount managed. Quantified achievements help both ATS and hiring managers.</p>

          <h2>6. Keep file type and structure ATS-friendly</h2>
          <p>Save and upload resumes in ATS-friendly formats such as .pdf or .docx (most ATS accept both). Avoid embedding text within images and keep a clear, single-column layout.</p>

          <h2>7. Include a skills section</h2>
          <p>A concise skills list helps ATS quickly identify matches. Group related skills (e.g., Languages: JavaScript, Python; Frameworks: React, Next.js) and avoid long narrative paragraphs for technical skills.</p>

          <h2>8. Tailor for each application</h2>
          <p>Customize your resume for each role by adjusting the summary, skills, and top achievements to match the job. Even small changes can improve ATS relevance.</p>

          <h2>9. Review and test</h2>
          <p>Use the ResuMate tool to preview and download ATS-optimized versions, and test your resume by uploading it to job boards or ATS-friendly resume checkers.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Tailoring your resume for ATS is about clarity and relevance: use standard headings, mirror keywords, quantify achievements, and prioritize the most relevant experience. With focused edits, your resume will get noticed more often by both software and people.</p>
