# How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine:

1. Clone the Repository
Begin by cloning the project repository to your local system. Use the following command in your terminal:

# https://github.com/csujeet/TailorCVs.git

2. Install Dependencies
Navigate into the project directory and install all required npm packages using:

npm install

3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your Gemini API key:
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

Make sure to replace your-api-key-here with your actual Gemini API key. This key allows the application to connect to Gemini services for enhanced functionality.


4. Start the Development Server
Run the development server to launch the application locally:
npm run dev


Once started, the application should be accessible at localhost, unless configured otherwise.
